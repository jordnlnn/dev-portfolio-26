# Dev Portfolio — 2026 (In progress)

A focused, single-page developer portfolio showcasing application-focused frontend work.

This site is designed to communicate my approach to building modern web interfaces: thoughtful UI behavior, clear structure, and maintainable React code.

---

## Purpose

This portfolio is intentionally **curated, not exhaustive**.

It is built to:

- Present me as an application-focused frontend developer
- Emphasize React, data-driven UI, and stateful interfaces
- Prioritize clarity, readability, and intent over visual excess

It is **not** a catalog of all past work.

---

## Tech Stack

- **React (Vite)**
- **Sass (SCSS)**
- **CSS custom properties**

Typography:

- **Inter** — body copy and long-form content
- **Roboto Mono** — headings, navigation, and UI text

---

## Structure

The site is a single-page layout with anchored sections:

- Hero
- About
- Experience
- Projects
- Contact

The Projects section is deliberately limited to a small number of application-focused builds to reduce noise and improve signal.
